## **Summary**

*The Hangman classic.*<br />


The Start of the Trial: A secret word is chosen and hidden. Only the number of letters is revealed to you, each letter hidden by a line.

The Choice of Letters: Each round, you propose a letter. A crucial strategic choice to advance in the discovery of the word.

Revelation or Danger: If your letter is in the word, it appears on the board, revealing its position. But be careful, if the letter is not in the word, an element of the drawing of the hanged man is added: a head, a body, arms, legs...

A Race Against Death: You are allowed only 10 mistakes. With each mistake, the drawing of the hanged man is completed. If you reach 10 errors, the drawing is complete, and the sentence is irrevocable: you are symbolically “hanged”.

The Quest for Salvation: To avoid this fate, you must guess all the letters of the mystery word before the drawing of the hanged man is completed.

End of the Game: The game ends either with your victory by guessing the word, or with your defeat if the drawing of the hanged man is completed first.
In this version you can also:

+ Chrismas mode :The words are related to Christmas.
